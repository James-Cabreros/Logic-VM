## Abstract
LogicGateVM is an innovative web-based application designed to simplify the understanding and visualization of digital logic circuits. The system allows users to input logical expressions using standard operators (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) and generates interactive visual representations of the corresponding circuits. By combining modern web technologies with educational principles, LogicGateVM provides real-time visualization of logic gates, CPU execution simulation, and memory/register state tracking. This tool bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation of digital logic, making it an invaluable resource for students, educators, and professionals in computer architecture and digital design.

## Introduction

### Background
Digital logic is fundamental to computer architecture and hardware design. Traditional methods of teaching and learning digital logic often lack interactive visualization tools that can help users understand the relationship between logical expressions and their hardware implementations. LogicGateVM addresses this gap by providing an intuitive, visual approach to logic circuit design and simulation.

### Objectives
1. Create an accessible platform for visualizing logic circuits from text expressions
2. Provide real-time validation and feedback for logical expressions
3. Demonstrate CPU-level execution of logic operations
4. Visualize memory and register states during operation
5. Support educational and professional use cases with clear, interactive visualizations

### Scope
The project encompasses:
- Expression parsing and validation
- Logic gate visualization
- Truth table generation
- CPU execution simulation
- Memory/register state visualization
- User interface for interaction and control

### Methodology
The development follows a component-based architecture using React and Material-UI, with emphasis on:
- Modern web development practices
- Responsive design principles
- Real-time user interaction
- Modular component structure
- Clean code architecture
